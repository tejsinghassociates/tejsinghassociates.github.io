                                One of the important regulation to which most businesses in India are subject to is the Shop and Establishment Act,
                                enacted by every state in India. The Act is designed to regulate payment of wages, hours of work, leave, holidays,
                               terms of service and other work conditions of people employed in shop and commercial establishments. In this article we

                                 The Shop and Establishment Act in India is promulgated by the state and may slight differ from state to state. However, as
                                 per the Act, all shops and commercial establishments operating within each state are covered by the respective Shop &
                                 Establishments Act. Shops are defined as premises where goods are sold either by retail or wholesale or where services are
                                 rendered to customers, and includes an office, a store-room, godown, warehouse or workhouse or work place. Establishments are

                                 dates, a copy of the certificate holder's public key (used for encrypting messages and digital signatures), and the digital signature
                                 of the certificate-issuing authority so that a recipient can verify that the certificate is real. Digital Signature Certificates have

                               <h3>Know about Digital Signature</h3>
                                 <p style="" class="content-para">
                                   A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of digital messages or documents. A valid digital
                                   signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication), that the sender cannot
                                   deny having sent the message (non-repudiation), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).<br>

                                   Digital signatures are a standard element of most cryptographic protocol suites, and are commonly used for software distribution,
                                   financial transactions, contract
                                   management software, and in other cases where it is important to detect forgery or tampering.
                                 </p>
                                 <h3>Digital Signature</h3>
                                   <p style="" class="content-para">
                                     Digital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures, a broader term that refers to any electronic data that
                                     carries the intent of a signature, but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures. In some countries, including the
                                     United States, Turkey, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and the countries of the European Union,
                                     electronic signatures have legal significance.<br>
                                     Digital signatures employ asymmetric cryptography. In many instances they provide a layer of validation and security to messages
                                     sent through a non-secure channel: Properly implemented, a digital signature gives the receiver reason to believe the message
                                     was sent by the claimed sender. Digital seals and signatures are equivalent to handwritten signatures and stamped seals.[8]
                                     Digital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signatures in many respects, but properly implemented digital
                                     signatures are more difficult to forge than the handwritten type. Digital signature schemes, in the sense used here, are
                                     cryptographically based, and must be implemented properly to be effective. Digital signatures can also provide non-repudiation,
                                      meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message, while also claiming their private key remains
                                      secret; further, some non-repudiation schemes offer a time stamp for the digital signature, so that even if the private key is
                                       exposed, the signature is valid. Digitally signed messages may be anything re-presentable as a bitstring: examples include
                                       electronic mail, contracts, or a message sent via some other cryptographic protocol.<br>#Source:Wikipedia

                                  Fire NOC issued by the respective state fire service verifies that a building is resistant or unlikely to observe any fire related accidents. By meeting certain guidelines laid down by the fire department, an applicant can obtain NOC for his residential/ commercial building. The guidelines vary according to different states.
                                </p>
                                <h1>Why is Fire NOC important for your building?</h1>
                                  <p style="" class="content-para">Statistics indicate that every year, thousands of people are killed across the world as a consequence of fire and fire related accidents. Moreover property and goods worth crores of rupees are destroyed every year due to fire outbreak.
